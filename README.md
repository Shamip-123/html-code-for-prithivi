    <h2>First king of Nepal</h2>
<p>This visionary king was born in Gorkha on Poush 27, 1779 BS, as a first son to King Narabhupal Shah and queen Kausalyawati making him the crown prince and heir to the throne. He had a vision, to conquer all the small kingdoms and create a larger nation, which he never gave up on and was determined to fulfill it.From the time when he was just a small child, he had every quality required to be a good leader and King. Wrestling and swimming always caught his interest and his courage was no less during childhood than what it was during his young age or even old age. It is mentioned in history that he had received a blessing from his family priest Gorakhnath as well (he will conquer the land he steps on).
